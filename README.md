Usages:
> Please set up the image path and make sure it is correct and then run it in the main.m file. The main.m is used to execute the whole program. embedding.m is used for embedding the image bitstream and recovery.m is used for lossless recovery of the image. the processing file is used to perform the histogram equalization. The dataset used by the program and the matrics used are given. The user can try to improve the performance of the method by modifying and optimizing the program accordingly.
